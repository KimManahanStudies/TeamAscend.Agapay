    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Agapay PH is a disaster preparedness application designed to strengthen the resilience of
        communities in the Philippines, starting with Quezon City. As one of the most disaster-prone
        countries in the world, the Philippines faces frequent typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
        and other calamities. While the government and disaster response agencies work hard to provide
        support, many communities still struggle with limited access to timely information, efficient
        coordination, and proper emergency planning.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Agapay was created to address these challenges. The app serves as a centralized hub for real-time
        alerts, emergency resources, and disaster preparedness tools. By combining accurate information
        from trusted agencies such as PAGASA, PHIVOLCS, NDRRMC, and QCDRRMO, Agapay ensures that users
        receive reliable, location-specific updates when it matters most.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        More than just an information tool, Agapay empowers individuals and families to prepare ahead of
        time. It provides customizable emergency plans, evacuation routes, checklists, and first aid guides,
        helping users take control of their safety. It also promotes collaboration by offering group
        communication features and resource locators for shelters, hospitals, and supply stores.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        By integrating these features into one platform, Agapay aims to minimize confusion, improve
        response times, and save lives. Our mission is to promote a culture of preparedness and strengthen
        community resilience through technology—ensuring that no one is left behind in times of disaster.
    </p>
    <h2 class="fw-bold text-primary mb-4">About the Developers</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Agapay PH was developed by a group of student-developers (😎) from STI College Academic Center
        Cubao as part of our thesis project. As future IT professionals, we saw the urgent need to use
        technology in addressing real-world problems faced by Filipinos, especially in disaster preparedness
        and response.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Our goal is to create a simple, reliable, and accessible mobile application that can help save lives
        and strengthen community resilience. By combining our knowledge in programming, system design,
        and mobile development with guidance from our professors and collaboration with disaster
        response resources, we aim to contribute something meaningful to both the academic field and
        society.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We believe that technology should serve the people—and through Agapay, we hope to inspire
        innovation that not only addresses local challenges but also creates a positive impact on
        communities in need.
