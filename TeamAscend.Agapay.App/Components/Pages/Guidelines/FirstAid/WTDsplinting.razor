            <h3 class="subsection-title">Splinting Techniques</h3>
            <p class="intro-text">Proper splinting provides support and immobilization to reduce pain and the risk of further injury. Here's how to apply splints for different types of injuries:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li class="bullet-item"><strong>Improvised Splints:</strong> Use boards, sticks, or rolled newspapers if medical tools are unavailable.</li>
                <li class="bullet-item"><strong>Ankle Sprains:</strong> Place a firm object like folded cardboard on the side of the ankle and secure it.</li>
                <li class="bullet-item"><strong>Finger Fractures:</strong> Use buddy taping by attaching the injured finger to an adjacent one.</li>
                <li class="bullet-item"><strong>Arm and Leg Fractures:</strong> Use padded splints and secure above and below the injury site.</li>
                <li class="bullet-item"><strong>Joint Support:</strong> Immobilize both the joint and bones above and below it.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="before-start">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">When NOT to Splint</h3>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li class="bullet-item"><strong>Open Fractures:</strong> Do not realign bones. Stabilize the area without pressure.</li>
                <li class="bullet-item"><strong>Nerve or Blood Vessel Issues:</strong> If numbness, tingling, or circulation loss occurs, loosen the splint slightly.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="begin-cpr">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Seek Medical Attention</h3>
            <p>While splinting can provide temporary support, it's essential to seek medical attention for fractures and severe sprains. Professional assessment and treatment will ensure the best possible outcome.</p>
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Important Tips:</h3>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li class="bullet-item">Always ensure the splint is snug but not too tight, as this can affect circulation.</li>
                <li class="bullet-item">Do not attempt to reset or reposition a fracture unless you're a trained medical professional.</li>
                <li class="bullet-item">Monitor the injured person for any changes in color, sensation, or temperature below the injury site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="intro-text">In conclusion, learning the art of splinting is an invaluable skill that can make a significant
                difference in managing fractures and sprains. While splinting provides immediate support, professional medical evaluation
                is crucial for proper diagnosis and long-term care. By following these techniques and prioritizing the well-being of the
                injured person, you can effectively contribute to their comfort and recovery.</p>
